# REFUGE Challenge - Evaluation

## Requirements

You will need **Python 3.6**.

The following libraries are also used:

- sklearn 0.19.3

- numpy 1.14.3

- openpyxl


## Usage

In this section we explain how to use the code.

### Evaluate a single submission

To evaluate a single submission, use the script ```evaluate_single_submission.py```.

### Evaluate multiple submission

To evaluate multiple submissions, use the script ```evaluate_multiple_submission.py```.

### Generate leaderboards

To generate the leaderboards for the challenge, use the script ```generate_leaderboards.py```.
Make sure that you have executed ```evaluate_multiple_submission.py``` first, because you need to provide the table of results produce by that script.
